This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript: the silent failure of late-bound method calls.  When using late binding, VBScript does not raise an error if you attempt to call a method that doesn't exist on an object. This can lead to difficult-to-debug issues where the script appears to run without errors but produces incorrect results.  The `LateBindingBug.vbs` file shows this issue, while `LateBindingSolution.vbs` offers a solution using error handling.
